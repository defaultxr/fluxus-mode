;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides an interface to the Fluxus live coding environment.
;;
;; According to the official Fluxus site at http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/ ,
;; Fluxus is a 3D game engine for livecoding worlds into existence.  It is
;; a rapid prototyping, playing and learning environment for 3D graphics,
;; sound and games.  It extends the Racket language with graphical commands
;; and can be used within its own livecoding environment or from within the
;; DrRacket IDE.
;;
;; This package allows Fluxus to be used from within Emacs.
